# Making TTS Sound Like Conversation, Not Narration

**A research + implementation guide for braidio (ElevenLabs, `mixing.text_to_speech`)**

_Last updated: 2026-07-22. Scope: ElevenLabs `eleven_multilingual_v2` and `eleven_v3` (audio tags), current as of the model's GA API release (Aug 2025) and after._

---

## Executive summary — the highest-impact changes to stop sounding "narrated"

braidio currently synthesizes **every line as an independent single-voice call** to `eleven_multilingual_v2` with narration-tuned settings (`stability: 0.5, similarity_boost: 0.8, style: 0.0`), then stitches. That pipeline **structurally cannot** produce conversation: `multilingual_v2` has no audio-tag or disfluency vocabulary, and per-line synthesis means no speaker ever *reacts* to another — prosody can't carry across a turn boundary because each turn is generated in isolation. The result is alternating monologues [1][6][12].

The five changes that matter most, in priority order:

1. **Use a different model *and* API for the conversational register.** Route conversational passages through **ElevenLabs Text to Dialogue** (`POST /v1/text-to-dialogue`, `eleven_v3` only), which synthesizes a *whole multi-speaker exchange in one pass*, "matching prosody, emotional range and taking cues from audio tags" so speaker B's delivery is conditioned on speaker A's turn [1][2][7]. This single change does most of the work — it is the mechanism NotebookLM/DeepMind use (single autoregressive pass over the whole dialogue, not line-by-line) [8][9].

2. **Manufacture disfluency in the *script*, deliberately.** The single most-cited reason NotebookLM sounds human: after generating a clean script, a dedicated stage *adds* "the banter and the pauses and the likes… because you cannot listen to two robots talking to each other" [8][9][15]. Write backchannels (`right`, `mm-hm`, `yeah`, `exactly`), reactive fragments, self-interruptions (em-dash), contractions, and trailing `…` into the copy. Do **not** rely on the model to invent them.

3. **Loosen the voice settings for the conversational cast.** Narration wants steady (`Natural`/`Robust` stability, low `style`); conversation wants variability — v3 **Creative** or **Natural** stability, so audio tags and reactive prosody actually fire [3][4][14].

4. **Pick conversational-labelled voices, not narrator voices.** ElevenLabs' library separates `conversational` voices ("relaxed yet confident… dynamic co-host style") from `narrator`/`audiobook` voices; the timbre and default cadence differ [10][11].

5. **Engineer turn-taking at the audio layer only where the model can't** — tight inter-turn gaps and short (~150–400 ms) overlaps on *backchannels/interjections only*. Overlapping content words turns to mush [8][12]. This is where braidio's weave-engine `overlap` parameter earns its keep.

Keep the **narration register exactly as it is** (`multilingual_v2`, steady settings) — it is already correct for a single consistent reading voice. The work is entirely in adding a *second* register, not changing the first.

**Reliable now:** Text to Dialogue + audio tags on `eleven_v3`; scripted disfluencies; conversational voice selection; settings changes; audio-layer gap/overlap engineering. **Experimental:** exotic sound-effect/environment tags; precise overlap *timing* from tags alone; deterministic reproducibility (v3 is nondeterministic even with a seed) [2][5].

## 1. What makes TTS sound "narrated" vs "conversational"

Read/narrated speech and spontaneous conversational speech differ measurably and consistently — speech-recognition and style-classification research treats the distinction as robust enough to *classify* audio by it [12][13][19].

| Dimension | Narration (read) | Conversation (spontaneous) |
|---|---|---|
| **Speaking rate** | Even, moderate | Faster and more *variable*; bursts + slowdowns [12][19] |
| **Pitch (F0)** | Controlled, gradual contours, wider planned arcs | Wider *local* range, uptalk on questions, sharp reactive jumps [12][19] |
| **Pausing** | Regular, longer, at clause boundaries (~500–700 ms) | Shorter gaps between turns (~200 ms), *filled* pauses ("uh", "um"), mid-clause breaks [12][19] |
| **Fluency** | Fluent, complete sentences | Disfluencies: repairs, restarts, partial words, hesitations, repetitions [12][19] |
| **Turn structure** | One voice, monologue | Interactivity: speaker turns, **overlap**, backchannels [12][13] |
| **Non-verbal** | Rare | Laughter, breath, sighs, "mm-hm", gasps [8] |
| **Sentences** | Complete, well-formed | Fragments, incomplete thoughts, self-interruption |

**What current ElevenLabs TTS can and cannot produce:**

| Feature | `eleven_v3` | `eleven_multilingual_v2` |
|---|---|---|
| Laughter, sighs, breath, throat-clear | Yes — `[laughs]`, `[sighs]`, `[exhales]`, `[clears throat]` [4][5] | No |
| Emotional reactivity (`[excited]`, `[sarcastic]`, `[annoyed]`) | Yes [3][5] | No (only global stability/style) |
| Whisper / shout / deadpan delivery | Yes — `[whispers]`, `[shouts]`, `[deadpan]` [3][5] | No |
| Interruptions / overlap cues | Yes — em-dash + `[interrupting]`/`[overlapping]` [4] | No |
| Uptalk on questions | Partial (punctuation-driven; stronger in v3) | Weak |
| Filler words ("um", "like") | Rendered if **written into the text**; not auto-inserted [8][9] | Rendered as literal text, flatly |
| Cross-turn prosody (B reacts to A) | **Yes, via Text to Dialogue** (single pass) [1][2] | No |
| Steady, consistent long read | Possible (Robust) but overkill | **Yes — its strength** [14] |

The decisive gap is the last row. Backchannels and disfluencies you can *write*; but a speaker sounding like they *heard* the other speaker requires the turns to be generated together — which only Text to Dialogue (or a NotebookLM-style single-pass model) does [1][2][8].

## 2. ElevenLabs conversational features

### 2.1 Models (choose per register)

| Model ID | Latency | Audio tags | Multi-speaker | Best for | Role in braidio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eleven_v3` | ~1–2 s (not real-time) | **Yes** | **Yes (Text to Dialogue)** | Storytelling, character voices, drama, dialogue [14] | **Conversational register** |
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | ~1–2 s | No | No | Audiobooks, podcasts, narration [10][14] | **Narration register (keep)** |
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` / `eleven_flash_v2_5` | ~75 ms | No | No | Real-time agents/chatbots [14] | Not needed (braidio is offline) |

`eleven_v3` reached **general availability with public API access on 20 August 2025** (`model_id: "eleven_v3"`) [15][16]. It is explicitly **not** recommended for real-time use (higher latency, needs prompt engineering) — which is fine for an offline podcast renderer.

### 2.2 Text to Dialogue — the key conversational primitive

**Endpoint:** `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-dialogue` (only on `eleven_v3`) [2][7].

It "weaves multiple voices together to create a seamless interaction… matching prosody, emotional range and taking cues from audio tags" [1] — i.e. it is a *dialogue*-native call, not a loop over Text to Speech.

**Request body** [2]:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    { "text": "[giggling] Knock knock", "voice_id": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb" },
    { "text": "[curious] Who is there?", "voice_id": "Aw4FAjKCGjjNkVhN1Xmq" }
  ],
  "model_id": "eleven_v3",
  "settings": { "stability": 0.5 },
  "seed": 12345
}
```

- `inputs`: array of turns, each `{ text, voice_id }`. **No limit on number of speakers**; audio tags go *inside* each turn's `text` [1][2].
- Optional: `model_id` (default `eleven_v3`), `language_code`, `settings`, `seed` (0–4294967295; still nondeterministic), `apply_text_normalization` (`auto`/`on`/`off`), `pronunciation_dictionary_locators` (≤3).
- Query: `output_format` (e.g. `mp3_44100_128`), `enable_logging`.
- **Hard limit: total of all `inputs[].text` ≤ 2000 characters per request** [2] — long exchanges must be chunked (see §4).
- Response: binary audio (the *whole* exchange as one clip).

This is a **new function** braidio must add — the existing `text_to_speech` hits `/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}` (single voice) and cannot express turns.

### 2.3 Audio tags useful for conversation

Tags are natural-language directives in `[square brackets]`, placed **immediately before the span they affect**; the `voice_id` still picks the speaker while the tag guides delivery [1][5]. Reliability tiers (v3 was an alpha research preview — "requires more prompt engineering than previous models" [5]):

**Reliable — non-verbal & reactions:** `[laughs]`, `[laughs harder]`, `[starts laughing]`, `[chuckles]`, `[giggles]`, `[sighs]`, `[exhales]`, `[gasps]`, `[clears throat]`, `[gulps]` [4][5].

**Reliable — emotion:** `[excited]`, `[curious]`, `[sad]`, `[angry]`, `[happily]`, `[nervous]`, `[annoyed]`, `[flustered]`, `[sarcastic]`, `[mischievously]`, `[crying]` [3][5][17].

**Reliable — delivery direction:** `[whispers]`, `[shouts]`/`[shouting]`, `[deadpan]`, `[flatly]`, `[cheerfully]`, `[playfully]`, `[pauses]`, `[hesitates]`, `[stammers]`, `[drawn out]`, `[rushed]` [3][5].

**Useful but less deterministic — dialogue dynamics:** `[interrupting]`, `[interrupts]`, `[cuts in]`, `[overlapping]`, `[overlapping speech]`, `[interjecting]`, `[starting to speak]` [4]. These *influence* timing but do not guarantee sample-accurate overlap (see §4).

**Experimental / voice-dependent — accents & SFX:** `[strong French accent]`, `[strong Texas accent]`; `[applause]`, `[clapping]`, `[gunshot]`, `[explosion]`, `[leaves rustling]` [1][5]. Third-party "1450+ tag" catalogues adding `[forest ambient]`, `[night dreamy]`, `[noir]`, etc. are **aspirational, not officially supported** — treat as experimental [18].

**Two critical caveats:**
- **Tags must match the voice's character.** A tag like `[giggles]` on a grave "documentary narrator" voice is often ignored or sounds wrong; the voice's own range bounds what tags do [5].
- **Stability gates tags.** On `Robust`, directional tags are largely ignored (behaves like v2); use `Creative`/`Natural` for tags to fire [3][14].

### 2.4 Voice selection: conversational vs narrator

ElevenLabs' library is explicitly split. **Conversational** voices are "relaxed yet confident… clear, personable… dynamic co-host style" [10]; **narrator/audiobook** voices are "authoritative… professional-level pacing" for long-form reading [11]. `list_voices()` returns a `labels` dict with `use_case` (`conversational`, `narration`, etc.) and `description` — filter on these. For the two-host cast, pick **two contrasting conversational voices** (e.g. different gender/age/pitch) so turn-taking is audible; for narration keep one steady narrator voice.

### 2.5 Voice settings per feel

| Setting | Narration (steady) | Conversation (loose) |
|---|---|---|
| `stability` (v2, 0–1) | ~0.5 (current) | ~0.3 — varied & expressive [14] |
| v3 stability **mode** | `Natural` or `Robust` | **`Creative`** (most emotional; hallucination-prone) or `Natural` (balanced) [3][14] |
| `similarity_boost` | ~0.8 (current) | ~0.75 (library sweet spot) [14] |
| `style` (0–1) | 0.0 (current) | 0.1–0.4 if the voice needs a nudge; start 0.0 [14] |
| `speed` | 1.0 | 1.0–1.1 (conversation is faster/looser) [12] |
| `use_speaker_boost` | true | true |

v3 exposes stability as three discrete modes: **Creative** ("more emotional and expressive, but prone to hallucinations"), **Natural** ("closest to the original voice recording — balanced and neutral"), **Robust** ("highly stable, less responsive to directional prompts… similar to v2") [3]. Via the API these correspond to `stability` values (roughly Creative≈0.0, Natural≈0.5, Robust≈1.0) — lower = more expressive.

## 3. Scripting techniques for natural dialogue

This is where braidio has the most leverage, and it's mostly **writing**, not TTS config. The DeepMind/NotebookLM pipeline is the template: generate a clean script, then a dedicated pass **injects** disfluency and banter before synthesis [8][9]. braidio should do the same — a "conversationalize" transform on the commentary text before it hits Text to Dialogue.

**Rules for writing two-person commentary so v3 renders it conversationally:**

1. **Short turns.** Break long commentary into 1–2 sentence turns that ping-pong. Long turns re-collapse into narration.
2. **Contractions everywhere.** "it is" → "it's", "that is" → "that's". Formal orthography reads as reading.
3. **Reactive fragments that reference the other speaker.** `[laughs] Right, and that "ten-dollar founding father" line—` Fragments + a callback to what was just said = the model (and listener) hears a *response*.
4. **Self-interruption with em-dashes.** `So the whole verse is basically— [interrupting] —a mission statement, yeah.` Em-dash is the reliable interruption/cutoff signal across v3 docs [4][5].
5. **Trailing hesitation with ellipses.** `I mean… it's ambitious, right?` Ellipses create natural pauses [5].
6. **Backchannels as their own micro-turns.** Insert `right`, `mm-hm`, `yeah`, `exactly`, `wait—`, `huh` as short turns from the *listening* speaker. In Text to Dialogue these become genuine reactions; at the audio layer they can be laid *under* the other voice (§4).
7. **Questions that hand off (uptalk).** End a turn on a real question so the next speaker answers: `…but does that hold up by the second verse?` Question marks drive rising intonation [5].
8. **CAPS for emphasis, sparingly.** `That's the WHOLE point.` Capitalization adds stress [5].
9. **Emotion/reaction tags at turn starts, matched to the voice** (§2.3). `[excited]`, `[skeptical]`, `[laughs]`.
10. **Give ≥250 characters of context per generation.** v3 is unreliable on very short isolated prompts; batching the exchange into one Text to Dialogue call (rather than tiny per-line calls) also satisfies this [3][5].

**How much to script vs. leave to the model:** Script the *structure and disfluencies explicitly* (turns, fragments, em-dashes, backchannels, tags) — the model will not reliably invent them, exactly as Google found necessary [8][9]. Leave *fine prosody* (pitch contour, micro-timing, breath) to v3 — over-tagging every word causes hallucination on `Creative` [3][5]. Rule of thumb: **1 tag per turn**, at the start, plus punctuation.

**Worked example** (same beat, three registers):

- _Narrated (current output):_ "Hamilton describes himself as a ten-dollar founding father without a father. The line establishes his ambition and his outsider status."
- _Conversational script for Text to Dialogue:_
  ```
  Host A: [amused] Okay, "ten-dollar founding father without a father"—
  Host B: [jumping in] —he's putting his own face on the money in line one.
  Host A: Right? [laughs] It's a flex AND an origin story.
  Host B: Exactly. And "without a father"… that's the whole outsider thing in four words.
  Host A: Mm-hm.
  ```

## 4. Overlap / turn-taking realism at the audio layer

Two ways to get overlap, with different fidelity:

**(a) Let the model do it (preferred).** Because Text to Dialogue renders the whole exchange in one pass, scripting `—` + `[interrupting]`/`[overlapping]` makes the model produce genuine crosstalk with correct prosody — the same mechanism as DeepMind's SoundStorm single-pass dialogue synthesis, which handles "overlapping speech, natural pacing" learned from annotated multi-speaker data [4][8]. **Limitation:** you cannot *dial* the overlap amount; it's whatever the model does. Good for realism, weak for control.

**(b) Engineer it at the stitch layer (braidio's weave engine).** When you must synthesize turns/chunks separately (e.g. exchange > 2000 chars, or you want a controllable `overlap` knob), assemble with these audio-layer moves:

- **Tighten inter-turn gaps.** Conversation gaps ≈ 200 ms vs narration pauses ≈ 500–700 ms [12][19]. Just closing gaps is the cheapest single audio-layer win.
- **Short, targeted overlaps only.** Overlap the *tail* of turn A under the *head* of turn B by ~**150–400 ms**, and **only** for backchannels/interjections — never overlap two streams of content words, which reads as mush [8][12]. This maps directly onto braidio's `overlap` parameter: cap it, and gate it to interjection turns.
- **Backchannel bed.** Render `mm-hm`/`right`/`yeah` as separate low-level clips and mix them *under* the speaking turn at −8 to −12 dB, offset a beat in — this is the acoustic signature of "someone is listening" and is very cheap to add.
- **Crossfade at the seam** (10–30 ms) so stitched turns don't click.

**Relation to NotebookLM style:** the two-host "deep dive" feel comes from (1) a script with manufactured banter/disfluency and (2) single-pass multi-speaker synthesis that lets prosody flow across turns and produces natural overlap [8][9][20]. braidio can approximate (2) with Text to Dialogue and, where it stitches, approximate the *timing* portion with (b). Doing only per-line TTS + fixed gaps reproduces neither — hence "narrated."

---

## 5. Per-register parameterization — concrete recommendation

Expose **two named registers** in braidio's config, each a self-contained bundle (SSOT — one dict per register, no scattered magic numbers):

```python
# Narration register — keep as-is (a single steady reading voice)
NARRATION = {
    "model_id": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
    "api": "text_to_speech",              # existing /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
    "voice_selection": {"use_case": "narration"},   # ONE voice, held constant
    "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5, "similarity_boost": 0.8,
                       "style": 0.0, "use_speaker_boost": True},
    "scripting": "verbatim passage, complete sentences",
    "timing": {"inter_gap_ms": 600, "overlap_ms": 0},
}

# Conversation register — the new one
CONVERSATION = {
    "model_id": "eleven_v3",
    "api": "text_to_dialogue",            # NEW /v1/text-to-dialogue (whole exchange, one call)
    "voice_selection": {"use_case": "conversational", "cast_size": 2},  # 2+ contrasting voices
    "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.35, "similarity_boost": 0.75,
                       "style": 0.3, "use_speaker_boost": True},        # v3: Creative/Natural
    "scripting": "short turns, contractions, em-dash interruptions, "
                 "ellipsis hesitations, 1 audio-tag/turn, backchannel micro-turns",
    "timing": {"inter_gap_ms": 200, "overlap_ms": 250,   # only on interjections
               "backchannel_bed_db": -10},
    "chunk_char_limit": 2000,             # Text to Dialogue hard limit → chunk longer exchanges
}
```

Implementation notes:
- Add a `text_to_dialogue(turns, *, voices, model_id="eleven_v3", settings, seed, output_format, ...)` function alongside `text_to_speech` in `mixing/dubbing/tts.py`, POSTing to `/v1/text-to-dialogue` with the `inputs` array. Reuse the existing cache keying (include the full turn list + voice map + settings in the SHA-256).
- braidio's weave engine keeps its `overlap` parameter but **gates it to the conversation register and to interjection turns only**, capped at ~400 ms.
- The "conversationalize" script transform (adding disfluencies/backchannels/tags to clean commentary) is a separate, testable text→text step — mirror NotebookLM's dedicated disfluency stage [8][9].

### Experiment matrix (A/B on one short two-person exchange)

Use the same ~5-turn beat (e.g. the "ten-dollar founding father" example above) for every variant. Judge on a blind 1–5 "sounds like two people talking, not reading" scale.

| # | Model / API | Voices | Settings | Scripting | Timing / overlap | What it isolates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V0** _control_ | `multilingual_v2`, per-line TTS | 2 narrator voices | stab 0.5, style 0.0 | plain sentences | fixed 600 ms gaps, no overlap | Current braidio baseline |
| **V1** | `multilingual_v2`, per-line TTS | 2 **conversational** voices | stab **0.3**, speed 1.05 | plain sentences | gaps **200 ms** | Do voice + settings + tighter gaps alone help? |
| **V2** | `multilingual_v2`, per-line TTS | 2 conversational | stab 0.3 | **disfluencies + backchannels scripted in** | 200 ms gaps + **250 ms overlap on interjections + backchannel bed −10 dB** | Value of *scripting + audio-layer overlap* without v3 |
| **V3** | **`eleven_v3`**, per-line TTS | 2 conversational | **Creative** (stab ~0.35) | **audio tags + fragments + em-dashes** | 200 ms gaps + engineered overlap | Value of v3 tags/expressiveness, still line-by-line |
| **V4** | **`eleven_v3` Text to Dialogue** (one call) | 2 conversational | Natural (stab ~0.5) | tags + em-dashes + backchannel turns | model-native turn-taking, no manual overlap | Value of **single-pass multi-speaker** synthesis |
| **V5** | **Text to Dialogue** + audio-layer polish | 2 conversational | **Creative** (stab ~0.35) | full conversationalize transform | model-native + **backchannel bed** + tight seam crossfades | Best-of-both ceiling |

Expected ordering (hypothesis): **V5 ≳ V4 > V3 > V2 > V1 > V0.** The big jump should be V3→V4 (single-pass dialogue) and V1→V2 (scripted disfluency) — if V4 doesn't clearly beat V3, the win is mostly in scripting; if it does, prioritize the Text to Dialogue integration. Run 2–3 seeds per variant since v3 is nondeterministic [2].

## Annotation / scripting cheat sheet

| Technique | How to write it | Model / where |
|---|---|---|
| **Laughter / breath** | `[laughs]`, `[chuckles]`, `[sighs]`, `[exhales]` before the span | `eleven_v3` only [4][5] |
| **Emotion on a turn** | `[excited]` / `[sarcastic]` / `[skeptical]` at turn start, 1 per turn | `eleven_v3` [3][5] |
| **Whisper / shout / deadpan** | `[whispers]`, `[shouts]`, `[deadpan]` | `eleven_v3` [3][5] |
| **Self-interruption / cutoff** | End turn with em-dash `—`; next turn `[interrupting] —…` | `eleven_v3` (em-dash works broadly; strongest in dialogue) [4][5] |
| **Overlap / crosstalk** | `[overlapping]` + em-dash in adjacent turns | `eleven_v3` Text to Dialogue (model-native) [4]; or engineer 150–400 ms overlap at stitch layer (any model) |
| **Hesitation / trailing off** | `…` (ellipsis) | Both; stronger in v3 [5] |
| **Emphasis** | `CAPS` on the stressed word | Both; stronger in v3 [5] |
| **Backchannel ("mm-hm", "right")** | Own micro-turn in `inputs`, or a separate clip mixed −10 dB under the other voice | v3 Text to Dialogue for reaction; `mixing` audio overlay for the bed |
| **Uptalk / hand-off question** | End turn on a real `?` question | Both (punctuation-driven) [5] |
| **Contractions / fragments** | Write "it's", "that's"; allow incomplete sentences | Any model (pure text) |
| **Reactive callback** | Quote/reference what the other just said in the next turn | Any model (pure text) — biggest "they're listening" cue |
| **Steady narration** | Complete sentences, no tags, `Natural`/`Robust` stability | `multilingual_v2` (keep) [14] |

**Punctuation rules (v3):** ellipses `…` → pauses; em-dash `—` → interruption/cutoff; CAPS → emphasis/volume; standard punctuation → rhythm [5].

## What's reliable now vs experimental

**Reliable now:**
- `eleven_v3` GA with API access (`model_id: "eleven_v3"`), Text to Dialogue endpoint [15][16][2].
- Non-verbal/emotion/delivery audio tags (§2.3 reliable tiers) [4][5].
- Single-pass multi-speaker synthesis giving cross-turn prosody [1][2].
- Scripted disfluencies/backchannels improving naturalness (industry-proven by NotebookLM) [8][9].
- Conversational voice selection and stability/settings changes [10][14].
- Audio-layer gap tightening and short interjection overlaps [12][19].

**Experimental / caveat:**
- Exotic SFX/environment/mood tags and giant third-party tag catalogues [18].
- Deterministic reproducibility — v3 is nondeterministic even with `seed`; expect variation [2].
- Precise, dial-able overlap *timing* from tags alone (model chooses; engineer at audio layer for control) [4].
- Very short prompts (<250 chars) render inconsistently on v3 — batch into dialogue calls [3][5].
- 2000-char per-request limit on Text to Dialogue forces chunking of long exchanges (re-introduces a seam to manage) [2].
- Tag effectiveness is voice- and stability-dependent — always A/B on the actual cast voice [5].
