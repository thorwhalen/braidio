description: >
  Use `braidio` to produce narrated commentary audio — a podcast-style episode
  that talks *about* something (a song, a book, a film, a paper, an event) and
  weaves in clips of the source. Trigger on requests like "make a podcast-style
  commentary", "turn this document/article/paper into an episode", "narrate over
  these clips", "two hosts discussing this", "duo commentary track", "panel
  discussion audio", "roundtable about this", "debate two sides of this", "audio
  essay", "documentary voice-over", "Song Exploder style breakdown",
  "interview-style audio", "deep dive on this track", "add a narrator over this
  song", "voice this script with two speakers", "commentary with clips of the
  original". Covers: authoring the Script of beats, picking a ready-made format
  template (solo / deep-dive / interview / panel / debate / documentary VO),
  estimating the ElevenLabs cost before paying, pulling source audio into an
  asset library, and rendering the mixed episode. For plain audio/video editing
  (trim, fade, concat, transcribe, dub) use `mixing` instead; braidio is the
  layer that *composes a production*.

# braidio — make a commentary production

braidio braids **talk** (synthesized narration or a multi-voice exchange) with
**clips of source media** into one mixed audio file. You write the words; braidio
casts the voices, cuts the clips, ducks them under the speech, normalizes
loudness, and masters the result.

Two ways in — same model underneath:

| You have | Use |
|---|---|
| the **braidio MCP connector** (tools named `help`, `render_format`, … or namespaced `braidio_*`) | the tool path below |
| the **Python package** (`pip install braidio`, ffmpeg on PATH, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` set) | the Python path below |

**Synthesis costs real money** (ElevenLabs, billed per character). Always
`estimate_cost` first, and ask the user about voice / format / length before
spending if any of it is unclear.

## Shortest path (MCP tools)

```
1. create_project("my-episode")                     # free
2. ingest_document("my-episode", uri="https://…")   # free — returns the text to analyze
   #   (or text="…" for pasted content)
3.  … you read that text and author a Script (see below) …
4. estimate_cost(script)                            # free — always do this
5. render_format("deep_dive", script)               # [COSTED] → an mp3 url in your workspace
```

That is the whole happy path for a narration-only episode. Variants:

- **Want provenance + partial re-render?** `save_script(project_id, script)`
  (free) then `weave_project(project_id, script)` (costed). Re-running
  re-synthesizes only what changed. Narration + segment beats only.
- **Want no project at all?** Skip step 1–2 and call `render_production(script)`
  or `render_format(format_id, script)` directly.
- **Just one voice reading one text?** `narrate(text)` — the smallest costed call.
- **Just a two-person exchange?** `render_dialogue([["A","…"],["B","…"]])`.

Discovery tools, all free: `help`, `list_formats`, `list_presets`,
`list_deliveries`, `list_voice_pools`, `describe_genre`.

## Shortest path (Python)

```python
import braidio
from braidio import Script, Narration, SegmentBeat, Dialogue, DEEP_DIVE

script = Script(
    title="What makes this song work",
    id_slug="01",
    beats=[
        Dialogue((("host_a", "The thing that gets me is the bass."),
                  ("host_b", "Say more — it's doing something odd, right?"))),
        Narration("Here's the passage in question —"),
    ],
)

print(braidio.estimate_cost(script).summary)   # "110 chars → $0.0330"
braidio.render_format(DEEP_DIVE, script, source=None, out_path="episode.mp3")
```

`source` is required as a keyword; pass `source=None` when the script has no
segment beats. For full manual control use `braidio.render_production(script,
source=…, cast=…, config=…, delivery=…, out_path=…)`.

## The Script — an ordered list of beats

Three beat types. Order is the timeline.

| Beat | Python | JSON (MCP) |
|---|---|---|
| **Narration** — one voice reading | `Narration(text, voice=…, voice_settings=…, style=…, lead_gap_s=…, published_text=…)` | `{"type": "narration", "text": "…"}` |
| **Dialogue** — a multi-speaker exchange, synthesized in ONE pass so it sounds like people talking to each other | `Dialogue(turns=(("A","…"),("B","…")), label=…)` | `{"type": "dialogue", "turns": [["A","…"],["B","…"]]}` |
| **Segment** — a span of source media to cut in | `SegmentBeat(reference, label=…, rights=…, placement=…, published_substitute=…)` | `{"type": "segment", "reference": "…", "rights": "owned-local"}` |

The envelope is `{"title": …, "id_slug": "01", "beats": [...]}`. `id_slug` is a
short stable id used to name the render.

Per-beat overrides are how one timeline carries contrasting roles: a lively
presenter and a graver book-narrator in the same episode is just
`Narration(text, voice_settings=braidio.V2_NARRATOR.voice_settings)` on the
beats that should read gravely.

`placement` on a segment beat is the weaving grammar:

- `"before"` (default) — set it up, then play the clip clean.
- `"after"` — play the clip clean, then react to it.
- `"under"` — the clip plays **concurrently beneath the next talk beat**, ducked.
  Put the segment beat immediately before the talk it should sit under.

## Format templates — start here, don't hand-roll

Each preset bundles the cast (role → voice), the narration voice + delivery, and
the mix defaults. `render_format(format_id, script)` / `braidio.render_format(FMT,
script, source=…)`.

| `format_id` | Standard name | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `solo_explainer` | Solo-Presenter Explainer (video/audio essay, close reading) | one presenter + exhibits |
| `deep_dive` | Two-Host Conversation ("Deep Dive") | two hosts; one teaches, one probes |
| `interview` | Interview (host + guest) | Q→A, the guest is the centre |
| `interview_host_removed` | Song Exploder-style (host removed) | guest monologue; each claim illustrated by its isolated stem; full artifact at the tail |
| `panel` | Panel / Roundtable | a moderator routes distinct voices |
| `debate` | Debate (Oxford-style) | proposition / opposition / moderator, phased |
| `documentary_vo` | Documentary Voice-Over ("Voice of God") | narrator on top; interviews + clips beneath |

Each `Format` also carries **authoring guidance** — `roles`, `scripting`, the
recommended `clip_placement` and `music_bed` intensity. Read it (`list_formats`,
or the `Format` object's `scripting` field) *before* writing the script: it tells
you the shape the format expects (cold open → walkthrough → recap; state the
motion up front; strip the host's questions; …). Use the role names from the
format's cast as your Dialogue turn roles.

## Bringing in source clips

A segment beat needs a **source**: time-aligned lines plus the media file to cut
from.

MCP, in order:

1. `download_audio(url)` for a song/video *page* link (YouTube, SoundCloud,
   Bandcamp…) — pulls the audio into your asset library and returns a
   ContentRef whose `itemId` is the handle. `upload_asset(uri=… | data_b64=…)`
   for a direct file URL or inline bytes. `list_assets` / `get_asset` to manage
   them.
2. Pass the source alongside the script:
   `{"asset_id": "<itemId>", "lines": [{"index": 0, "start_s": 0.0, "end_s": 4.2, "text": "…"}]}`
   (a server-local path goes in `asset_path` instead).
3. Each `SegmentBeat.reference` is matched against those lines by token-F1, so a
   paraphrase or a partial quote still resolves. `find_segment(lines, quote)` is
   free — use it to check a reference resolves before paying for a render.

Python: build a `braidio.TimedLineSegmentSource(lines=[TimedLine(...)],
asset_path="song.mp3")` and pass it as `source=`.

⚠️ Downloading audio grants no rights. Only pull material the user is entitled to
use, and set each segment beat's `rights` honestly.

## Knobs worth knowing

- **Delivery** (`list_deliveries`) — the speaking register. `"narration"`
  (default; reading a script) vs `"conversational"` (eleven_v3 with loosened
  stability, so inline `[audio tags]` and written-in disfluencies actually fire).
  Also `v2-presenter` (lively) / `v2-narrator` (graver) for contrast within one
  episode.
- **Voice pools** (`list_voice_pools`) — `"four"` and `"many"`, for narration
  that cycles voices across segments (`render_multivoice`, `assign_voices`).
- **WeaveConfig presets** (`list_presets`) — `single_narrator`,
  `documentary_lyrics`, `panel_4`, `interview_many`: casting, turn lengths,
  pacing, clip pre/post-roll, duck depth, loudness targets.
- **Music bed** — an instrumental laid under the whole production, ducked.
  braidio ships no music: pass your own asset (`bed_asset=` to
  `braidio.render_format`, or a `MusicBed(...)`).
- **Rights profile** — `"personal"` plays everything; `"published"` drops or
  substitutes non-publishable clips and beats carrying forbidden verbatim text.
  `plan_production(script, profile)` is a free dry run showing exactly what would
  be dropped; `content_violations(script, forbidden)` scans for leaks.
- **Writing helpers, all free** — `clean_text` (fix OCR ligatures, drop leaked
  speaker labels before TTS), `audit_platitudes` (flags recycled rhetorical tics
  and a per-1000-words rate), `narration_segments`, `build_timeline`.

## Gotchas

- **Estimate before you render.** The costed tools are `narrate`,
  `render_dialogue`, `render_multivoice`, `compose_narration`,
  `render_production`, `render_format`, `weave_project`. Everything else is free.
- **Dollars are a rate estimate, characters are exact.** If the connector reports
  an unpriced cost (`null` dollars), that means the rate is unconfigured — not
  that it is free. Quote the character count in that case.
- **Dialogue beats are not in the graph pipeline yet.** `save_script` and
  `weave_project` reject them with a clear error. Use `render_production` /
  `render_format` for anything with a Dialogue beat.
- **A segment beat with no source is an error, not a silent skip.** Narration-only
  scripts need no source at all.
- **Text-to-Dialogue is one request**: keep a single `Dialogue` beat's turns under
  roughly 2000 characters total, and split long exchanges into several beats.
- **eleven_v3 is nondeterministic.** Renders are cached on disk, so an unchanged
  exchange re-renders instantly and identically — but that freezes one random
  take. Pass a `seed` for reproducibility, or `refresh=True` to re-roll.
- **Repeated renders of unchanged text are free in reality** (disk cache) but the
  one-shot tools still report the rate estimate — a deliberate over-estimate.
- **ffmpeg must be on PATH** for every render path.
- **The dialogue has to be written disfluent.** The model will not invent
  backchannels, interruptions or fragments; if you want it to sound like people
  talking, write it that way — contractions, ellipses, half-sentences.
- **Renders land in the caller's own workspace** (MCP) and are returned as a
  url/path; audio bytes are never inlined in a tool result.
