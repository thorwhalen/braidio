"""Offline tests for the finished-production importer (braidio.importing).

Entirely synthetic: the fixtures are a handful of byte-strings on disk, because
nothing in the import path decodes an image or probes audio — geometry and
durations come from the manifest, and the only thing the bytes are used for is
the content-addressed artifact id. So no ffmpeg, no PIL, no network, no cost.

The real production manifests are **local data, not fixtures**: they live under
the user's data folder, carry paths into read-only source folders, and are far
too large to commit. The import of those is a verb, run by hand; what is
pinned here is the behaviour that makes running it safe.

Several tests are deliberate **negative controls** — they fail against the
obvious wrong implementation, which is the only reason they are worth having:

- ``test_a_manifest_that_says_auto_still_imports_as_push_in`` fails against an
  importer that passes ``move`` through, which is the version a reasonable
  person writes and which silently produces a different film.
- ``test_crop_is_converted_from_ltrb_not_passed_through`` fails against an
  importer that writes the manifest's 4-tuple as a Rect. Note that
  ``RectV1``'s unit-square validator catches only the minority of crops whose
  left+right exceeds 1, so "it validated" is not evidence here.
- ``test_a_no_op_reimport_rewrites_nothing`` fails against an importer that is
  merely *deduplicated* (right counts, every node rewritten), which looks
  idempotent in a census and stales every rendered cut underneath.
