"""The rights ``Profile`` through the **graph** path (thorwhalen/braidio#47).

The no-graph fast path has always filtered beats through
``braidio.plan_production``; the graph path did not. ``ingest_script`` walked
every beat unconditionally and the episode body's ``profile`` was the literal
``"personal"``, so a ``published`` render on the graph path quietly played
audio a ``published`` render on the fast path would refuse — and then labelled
the result a personal cut. On the live connector that was a caller rendering a
publishable episode out of personal-only sources with no filter in the way.

What these tests pin, and why each one exists:

- **The two paths agree.** :func:`test_a_published_profile_refuses_a_personal_only_segment`
  asserts the graph render contains no clip member for a segment the fast
  path's plan drops, and does it by comparing against ``plan_production``
  itself rather than against a hand-copied expectation — if the two ever
  disagree about what ``published`` means, this fails.
- **Legacy is untouched.**
  :func:`test_no_declared_profile_calls_weave_timeline_exactly_as_before` pins
  the transform's *call* — the items and every keyword — for a project that
  declares no profile. This is deliberately the same shape of characterization
  ``tests/test_transforms_structure.py`` uses, and for the same reason: a
  literal decoded-PCM hash captured from ``origin/main`` is not portable
  because CI renders on three ffmpeg builds and mp3 output is not stable
  across them. Pinning the call is what no change inside ``weave_timeline``
  can hide.
- **The decision is recorded**, not just enacted: the profile is a declared
  input of the episode transform, so it lands in provenance and re-stales the
  episode.

Nothing here reaches a network or a paid API; ``narrate`` writes a tone.
