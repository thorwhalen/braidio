"""braidio.downloads — the resolver half of render retrieval (braidio#10 item 1).

The defect these guard against is not a crash: every braidio render tool
*succeeded*, charged correctly, and returned a `file://` path on the connector's
own disk that no remote caller could read. It hid for months because on a local
stdio server that path IS openable by the human sitting there — it only becomes
visible the moment there is a remote caller, which is also the moment it costs
money.

So the contract under test is: resolve() is the ONLY authority mapping
(email, artifact_id) -> file, it refuses everything that is not the caller's
with KeyError (no existence leaks, no traversal), and the render tools hand out
claims rather than paths a remote caller cannot use.
