"""Turn a rendered production into a Ken Burns film over still images.

braidio's delegation table sends *video render* to ``reelee`` -- and still does
for anything with generated footage, characters or shots. This module is the one
case reelee cannot serve: reelee imports braidio, so braidio cannot import
reelee. What it needs instead is a leaf dependency, and pan/zoom over stills is
exactly that: :mod:`burns` owns the motion, this module owns *where the cuts go*,
which is braidio-specific knowledge because only braidio knows where a beat ends.

**Optional layer.** Nothing here is imported by ``braidio/__init__`` eagerly and
no function-level dependency is imported at module scope, so ``import
braidio.video`` succeeds with nothing extra installed. :data:`HAS_VIDEO` reports
whether the render path's dependencies (``braidio[video]`` -> ``burns``,
``pillow``) are actually present; :func:`plan_spans` and :func:`assign_stills`
are pure and work regardless.

The seams, and what each defaults to:

===================== ====================================== =========================

===================== ====================================== =========================

Deliberately *not* seams: sentence splitting, the credits-card layout, the
panel-length bounds. They are written directly, with constants at module top.

Why the blurred fill: a pool of found stills mixes portrait and landscape, and
cover-cropping a tall image into a wide frame throws most of it away. Compositing
onto a blurred, darkened enlargement of the image itself keeps the whole picture
and never shows dead black bars.
