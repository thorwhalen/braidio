"""Write a normalized production manifest into a real braidio project graph.

The verb is :func:`import_production`. It takes a
:class:`~braidio.importing._manifest.ProductionManifest` and a destination
project root and writes the stills, the episode audio (one node per distinct
mix — Two Silences renders a different mix per cut), the panel track for each
cut, the editorial cards, and the cut records with their ``published`` links.

**Idempotent by construction.** Every annotation id is a UUIDv5 of the
production slug plus a stable key, so a second run addresses the same nodes
rather than writing a second track beside the first. A node whose value is
unchanged is *left alone* rather than rewritten, because rewriting moves
``generated_at_time`` and would stale a rendered cut for no reason.

Four rules this module enforces rather than documents, each of which was a
measured defect in the three finished productions:

1. **Every imported panel is ``push_in`` — unless the manifest says its moves
   were rendered** (``moves="rendered"``, see :func:`_panel_move`). The source encodes a ``push`` /
   ``drift`` alternation, and it was a **no-op**: ``drift`` reached burns as
   ``mode="auto"``, whose only use of the index was ``push = index % 2 == 1``,
   and every project set style by the same ordinal it passed as the index — so
   both halves landed on push-in and all 265 panels of all three films push in
   (thorwhalen/braidio#72). Writing ``auto`` today would hand that panel to
   ``burns.choose_move``, which picks from a weighted pool and yields a real
   directional drift about 40% of the time: a substantially different film,
   arrived at by an import that believed it was being faithful. The
   never-realised intent is recorded as :data:`MOVE_IMPORT_NOTE` on the project
   and on every cut, so drift can be introduced **deliberately** later.
2. **The library's zoom default is asserted, not trusted.** 178 Two Silences
   panels carry a zoom that was never recorded in data — it was
   ``braidio.video.Panel``'s dataclass default, read off the source. If that
   default has moved, the extracted number is already wrong and this is the
   last place anyone would look, so :func:`assert_recorded_zoom_default` fails
   the import loudly.
3. **Every licence is stored as its canonical code, and an unknown one fails.**
   All 15 spellings across the three productions resolve to ``by`` / ``by-sa``
   / ``cc0`` / ``pdm`` through ``illustration.licensing.normalize_license``, so
   a failure means something genuinely new rather than a gap in the table.
   ``StillBodyV1.license`` gets the **code**, because that is what a gate
   compares and an unrecognised spelling survives normalization unchanged and
   therefore fails a published-profile check *silently* — fewer hits, no error.
   The human spelling is not discarded: it goes to ``license_label``, which
   ``credit_line`` prefers, so a credit still reads "CC BY-SA 4.0" while a gate
   still reads ``by-sa`` (thorwhalen/illustration#24).
4. **A context card is written with ``weight >= 2``.** ``video_cut.finish``
   refuses an overlay collision at plan time, and a weight-1 card over a
   labelled still is one, so a weight-1 context card would make the cut
   unrenderable at the point where it is least obvious why.
5. **Every registered artifact's catalog row carries the host's route, never a
   ``file://`` path.** An imported artifact that is not registered is a 404 on
   every surface (see :mod:`braidio.importing._catalog`), and one registered
   with a local path puts the importing machine's home directory into a served
   record. Registration is on by default; a cross-device destination refuses
   rather than silently copying the production a second time.
6. **A rendered take's ``cache_key`` cannot be mistaken for a computed one.**
   Every imported take carries a key prefixed :data:`IMPORTED_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX`,
   which no ``nw.transforms.cache_key`` digest can ever equal — the same
   bargain as a cut's ``cache_key=None``. braidio did not render these, so
   nothing may serve one as though it had.

**The delivered cut comes into the project; the motion pass does not.** The
plan's original line — cuts "referenced in place, not copied", to fit the
server's disk — is superseded, because a reference to a path outside the
project is not retrievable through *any* surface, and on the server that path
does not exist at all. The result was three finished films a reader could read
and could not watch. So ``materialize_cuts`` defaults to ``"delivered"``: every
cut record's delivered mp4 is brought in and registered, and *every* cut counts
— one production's four cuts are four different edits, not four versions of
one, and they are the point of that production. The **motion** pass stays out
by default: it is the text-free intermediate a re-render can resume from,
evidence rather than a deliverable, and carrying it roughly doubles the weight.
Measured, delivered-only across the three productions is about 1.1 GB, which
fits; ``"all"`` adds the motion passes and ``"none"`` restores the old
reference-in-place behaviour and *says* in the report that those cuts are
unretrievable.

What it deliberately does **not** do: mark anything publishable the source did
not (every cut keeps its recorded profile, and the rights finding is carried as
project-level data), or invent a beat it cannot witness — a beat whose authored
text did not survive is imported with an **empty** ``text`` and counted, never
with the timeline's 48-character snippet, which a re-synthesis would cheerfully
speak.

    """Write ``manifest`` into a braidio project at ``project_root``.

    **All or nothing — when the path did not already exist.** That qualifier
    is the whole of the guarantee, and it is deliberately not stronger. A
    refusal that fires after the first node is written (an unlinkable blob is
    the live case) would otherwise leave a CLI printing "import refused" over
    a directory holding a ``project.json``, a graph with one annotation and
    some media — the refusal saying nothing happened and the tree saying
    otherwise. So a project **this call created** is removed entirely.

    What is NOT promised, because promising it would mean deleting directories
    we did not create:

    - ``mkdir -p`` the path first — which is how people prepare one — and the
      rollback does not fire, so a refusal can leave exactly that half-written
      state. Measured.
    - A failed **re-import leaves an existing project partially updated**, not
      as it was found: annotations written before the failure keep their new
      values. A reader who retries expecting a clean slate is wrong. The price
      of never deleting somebody's project is that a failed run can leave it
      half-changed; re-running the import is how it converges.
    - Empty parent directories this call created are left behind. Removing
      directories because we also made them is the first step back down the
      road that produced the bug this guard exists for.

    Args:
        manifest: the normalized production (see ``load_manifest``).
        project_root: where the project lives. Created if absent; an existing
            project is updated in place, which is what makes a re-run one
            project rather than two.
        source_root: the folder ``manifest.source_dir`` is relative to. The
            manifest never stores an absolute path (one committed production
            manifest did, in a shared repo — only basenames come forward), so
            the caller supplies the root.
        copy_media: bring the stills, the episode audio and the narration
            takes into the project, so it is self-contained and survives being
            moved to a server. See :func:`_place_into` for why this is a copy
            and the blob store's link is not.
        dry_run: validate everything — files present, licences known, card
            weights sufficient, zoom default unmoved, beat kinds coherent —
            and write nothing.
        register_artifacts: register every artifact in the project's delivery
            catalog, so ``GET /api/artifacts/{id}/bytes`` answers instead of
            404ing. On by default: an unregistered artifact is a file the
            graph names and no surface can hand over.
        materialize_cuts: which rendered cuts come into the project —
            ``"delivered"`` (default; every cut's delivered mp4), ``"all"``
            (also the text-free motion passes), or ``"none"`` (reference them
            where they are, which means no surface can serve them; reported).
        allow_cross_device_copy: permit a real byte copy when the project's
            blob store is not on the media's filesystem. Off by default,
            because the copy is silent, is the whole production again, and is
            rarely what the caller meant.

    Returns:
        an :class:`ImportReport`.

    Raises:
        ImportError_: the manifest cannot be imported faithfully.
        CatalogBackendMismatch: the host reads artifacts from an object store.
        CrossDeviceCatalog: blobs cannot be linked and no copy was authorized.

    A project has to be **self-contained**: a body pointing at a path outside
    it is a reference the server it gets rsynced to cannot resolve, which is
    how three finished films arrived somewhere they could be read and not
    watched. So the bytes come in.

    They come in by **copy, not by hardlink**, and that is a decision with a
    measured reason. A same-volume link would make the project free, and the
    blob store below does exactly that — but the blob store links *within* the
    project, where the filename IS the digest, so a shared inode can only ever
    be rewritten with identical bytes. That argument does not transfer here.
    These sources live in shared working trees (one is a git checkout, all
    three are inside a syncing folder), and a link makes the source, the
    project's media and the blob **one inode**: an in-place rewrite upstream
    silently rewrites the project's copy *and* the blob, under a digest name
    that no longer describes its bytes, and content-addressing quietly stops
    holding. A rename-based writer (git checkout, an atomic save) breaks the
    link harmlessly; a truncating one does not, and nothing here can tell
    which a given tool is.

    So the copy is the price of the project owning its bytes. The saving that
    matters is kept: the blob store hardlinks from this copy, so registering
