"""Make an imported project's media *retrievable* — the delivery catalog.

An imported still, recording or film is recorded in the graph by its
content-addressed id, and until something registers it in the host's artifact
catalog, asking the host for it answers **404**. The writer that does that is
:mod:`nw.media_catalog` (nw#92): braidio and muvid each carried a copy of it, and
two copies of a wire contract whose row shape belongs to the host is how they
drift. Its docstring states the rules (id = content hash, blob before row,
hardlinked, never a ``file://`` url, refused on an object-store host).

This module keeps braidio's spelling of that writer — the functions the importer,
its CLI and its tests already call — and adds only what is braidio's own: the
importer's opt-out (``register_artifacts=False``) named in the backend refusal.
