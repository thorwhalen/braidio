"""Resolve a caller's rendered audio to its file — braidio's half of delivery.

Every braidio render tool returns ``out.as_uri()``: a ``file://`` path on the
connector's own filesystem, meaningless to a remote caller. A user paid $0.1233
and $0.0252 for two episodes that rendered correctly, passed every check, and
could not be retrieved by any tool on any surface. The defect hid for months
because on a local stdio server a ``file://`` path IS openable by the human
sitting at that machine — it only becomes visible the moment there is a remote
caller, which is also the moment it costs money.

This is the module braidio#10 called *"the actual deliverable of a costed
render"* and which that issue was closed without. Ownership follows the seam
agreed in reelee#252 §1 and already serving muvid:

- **braidio owns resolution** (this module): claim → file, authorised by the
  same per-email workspace scoping every tool uses. It never touches token,
  URL or page code.
- **The host owns transport**: one connector-owned route turning claims into
  signed, expiring URLs and a watch page.

Why braidio's references are names, not numbers
-----------------------------------------------
muvid names a render ``b02fc05417ea`` — a uuid slice nobody can say — so it
assigns ordinals (``cut 4``) and :mod:`nw.delivery` ships the parser for them.
braidio has the opposite problem and needs the opposite answer: its renders are
already titled by the person who made them (*"Why the Sky Looks Blue"*), and
layering ``episode 3`` on top of a real title would replace a good reference
with a worse one. So braidio's ``ref`` IS the title.

That is not an inconsistency in the seam — it is the seam working. A genre
supplies whatever reference is natural for it; ``Deliverable.ref`` means "the
label a human should say", and only the genre knows what that is.

Two locations, one caller-facing set (braidio#32)
-------------------------------------------------
A caller's audio lives in two places, and resolution spans both:

- **Flat renders** — every standalone render site (``render_production``,
  ``render_format``, ``narrate``, ``render_dialogue``, ``compose_narration``)
  writes through ``Workspace.render_path``: one flat per-caller directory keyed
  by the title the caller gave the render.
- **Project episodes** — the graph pipeline (``weave_project``) writes each
  assembled episode inside its project, at
  ``{project}/data/episodes/{annotation_id}.mp3``. That location is
  load-bearing: the episode annotation's body records that ``url``, and the
  partial-re-render DAG hangs off it. Delivery adapts to the graph's layout,
  never the other way around.

An earlier revision of this module claimed the project weaves wrote into the
flat directory too. They never did, and the one episode a paying caller
produced through the *documented* project-attached path was exactly the one no
tool could return (braidio#32). The lesson is the module's own founding lesson
one directory over: a resolver that covers only the layout its author
remembered is a resolver with an unreachable population.

``project_id`` still does not narrow anything: it is accepted and ignored.
Callers guess it — the connector requires *some* project_id for braidio but
never validates which, and nothing ties the value in a claim to where the
file actually lives — so treating it as a filter would refuse resolvable
claims over a field that carries no information. Episodes are found by
scanning the caller's own projects, which is bounded and email-scoped.
