"""Music bed — an instrumental underscore laid under the whole production, ducked.

The bed is the spanning generalization of a per-clip ``under`` placement: instead
of one clip beneath one talk beat, an app-supplied **instrumental** asset runs
beneath the entire timeline at reduced gain, entering after speech onset and
fading at the ends (the conventions from
``docs/research/commentary-formats-and-styles.md``: bed 10–15 dB under voice,
~1.5s fade-in, *posted* after the start; beds must be instrumental).

braidio ships **no music** — the caller supplies the asset (a licensed/owned
instrumental). A :class:`~braidio.formats.Format`'s ``music_bed`` *intensity*
(continuous / light / sparse / none) picks a sensible gain via
:data:`BED_GAIN_BY_INTENSITY`; :func:`render_format` builds the bed for you when
given a ``bed_asset``.

**Fade-to-spotlight** (:mod:`braidio.structure`) is expressed here as bed
*regions*: :func:`bed_regions` cuts the bed's span into the stretches around the
spotlit windows, each with its own fades, and :func:`prepare_bed_regions` renders
them so the weave mixes each in at its own start. With no spotlit window the bed
is one region rendered by :func:`prepare_bed` — the unchanged single-file path.
