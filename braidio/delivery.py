"""Narration *delivery* presets — model + voice settings (issue #10, expressiveness).

A :class:`Delivery` bundles the ElevenLabs ``model_id`` and ``voice_settings``
that shape how expressive vs flat a narration reads. The renderer takes one so
we can A/B the same script under different deliveries and pick what has the most
relief without editing the script.

Presets here are a starting point tuned from ``docs/research/expressive-tts-
narration.md``; refine as we learn what sounds best. The key monotony levers:
lower ``stability`` and raise ``style`` add variation (at some cost in
consistency); ``eleven_v3`` adds inline audio tags for real expressive control.

# --- v3 role deliveries: the defaults for the narration-heavy formats ---------
# The v2 pair above cannot render audio tags at all, so a solo script literally
# could not use ``[pause]`` / ``[dryly]`` out of the box. These are the same two
# roles on ``eleven_v3``, whose baseline is more dynamic and whose tags fire.
#
# **What actually makes a v3 read expressive — measured, not assumed.** One
# sentence, one voice, pitch range (f0 p5-p95) as the proxy for liveliness:
#
#   | lever                                     | effect              |
#   |-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
#   | plain text -> densely tagged text         | 70.8 Hz -> 124.4 Hz |
#   | voice choice (a warm read -> a vivid one) | 124 Hz  -> 199 Hz   |
#   | ``stability`` across its WHOLE range 0->1 | 85 Hz   -> 72 Hz    |
#
# So: **tag density is the engine and ``stability`` is nearly noise.** An earlier
# version of this file implied the reverse, and a production that varied
# stability between 0.30 and 0.65 to get "four registers" came out uniformly
# flat -- the listener's word was "somniferous". Those two values differ by
# about 2 Hz of pitch range. If you want colour, write it into the text and pick
# the right voice; do not reach for stability.
#
# Stability is therefore pinned at 0.0 on the presenter: it is the most
# expressive end, it costs nothing, and the per-take variance it buys is a
# feature in a read that is supposed to sound alive. Never 1.0 -- "Robust"
# suppresses tags and IS the robotic voice. Neither model has a speed knob, so
# tempo variation comes from :mod:`braidio.pacing` (real inter-turn silence)
# plus punctuation and tags.
