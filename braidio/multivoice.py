"""Multi-voice narration: cycle a pool of voices across segments (issue #10).

When one voice reads flat, variety across voices is a stronger lever than any
single-voice setting. This renders narration by splitting it into segments
(sentences) and assigning each a voice drawn from a pool — randomly (seeded, so
it's reproducible) and avoiding immediate repeats so it doesn't feel like a
rigid round-robin. Speed is jittered slightly per segment, even within one
speaker, to break regularity.

Two curated pools of **premade** ElevenLabs voices (all production quality,
deliberately less familiar than "George", 2M/2F in :data:`POOL_4`, wider in
:data:`POOL_MANY`). For a truly large "many people / interviews" pool, the
shared Voice Library (thousands) can be tapped, but quality varies there, so
those need curation — the premade pools below are the safe default.
