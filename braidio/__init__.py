"""braidio — weave narration with extracted media segments into productions.

Braid two kinds of strand into one production: authored **narration** (TTS —
single voice or a cycled pool) and extracted **segments** of source media (song
clips, audiobook passages, news, SFX). The result renders to an audiovisual
object.

This is the **functional core** (pure Python over files + numbers; deps:
``mixing``, ``elevenlabs``, and ``ffmpeg`` on PATH). An optional nw-app layer
(graph bodies, transforms, provenance / partial re-render) will be added on top
and imported only when ``nw`` is available — ``import braidio`` never requires
it.

Extracted from the Hamilton lyrics-podcast; the extraction is designed in
Hamilton#18 (the epic) and Hamilton#28 (placement + naming). Those numbers are
in the *Hamilton* repo — braidio has its own #18 about something else.
