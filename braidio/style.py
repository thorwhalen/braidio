"""Style audit — flag the recycled rhetorical tics in commentary text.

The companion, in code, to ``misc/docs/style/anti-platitude-checklist.md``: scan
authored commentary for the empty structural platitudes a writing model falls
back on, so a production can self-check (and measure) instead of eyeballing.

    from braidio.style import audit_platitudes, platitude_rate
    findings = audit_platitudes(commentary_text)   # [{pattern, match, start}, …]
    rate = platitude_rate(commentary_text)          # flagged hits per 1000 words

Not every match is a crime — the guide says these moves are fine *sparingly*; the
value is the RATE and which patterns dominate. Chiasmus ("the X that did Y is the
X that does Z") isn't reliably regex-detectable and is intentionally omitted.

# plain text 70.8 Hz -> densely tagged 124.4 Hz, a 76% widening. By comparison

# read; what you actually want is a *budget*, not abstinence.

# every sentence reads as kitsch, and it is the RELENTLESSNESS that gives it
# away, not any single tag. Hence a target band rather than a maximum.
