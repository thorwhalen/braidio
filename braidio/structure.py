"""Structural music — stings at scene breaks, fade-to-spotlight on exhibits.

The music bed (:mod:`braidio.music`) is the *continuous* music layer. This module
is the *structural* one: the cues that tell a listener where they are, because
audio has no visual white space (``misc/docs/research/commentary-formats-and-
styles.md``, "Music as structure"):

- a **sting** — a short musical marker — at a :class:`~braidio.script.SceneBreak`
  ("new section");
- **fade-to-spotlight** — the bed drops *out* before a key exhibit so the clip
  lands in silence instead of competing with underscore, and resumes after it.

Both are driven by a :class:`MusicStructure`: the format's defaults
(``scene_marker``, ``spotlight_clips``) plus the production's :class:`Sting`
asset. It is the single seam :func:`braidio.render.render_production` takes
(``structure=``); ``None`` means "no structure" and reproduces the plain weave
exactly. A beat overrides the defaults with ``SceneBreak.marker`` /
``SegmentBeat.spotlight``.

braidio ships **no music**: like the bed, the sting is an app-supplied asset
(``render_format(..., sting_asset=…)``). A scene break with no sting to play is
still audible — as :attr:`MusicStructure.pause_s` of silence — so the structure
is never silently lost.
