"""Render profiles: enforce personal-vs-published rights as data.

Rights are encoded on the beats (``SegmentBeat.rights``, and — mechanically —
the presence of forbidden verbatim text in narration) and a **render profile**
filters the script into the beats that may actually render:

- ``PERSONAL``  — include everything, including owned/copyrighted segment audio.
- ``PUBLISHED`` — exclude any non-publishable segment audio and any beat
  carrying forbidden verbatim text; keep original narration, publishable
  segments, and short transformative substitutes.

The rule is enforced *mechanically*: :func:`plan_production` routes beats by
their ``rights`` flag, and :func:`find_verbatim_text` / :func:`content_violations`
scan the resulting published beats against a **caller-supplied** set of
forbidden texts (via :class:`RightsPolicy`) — so a leak is a test failure, not a
judgment call. braidio owns the scanner + profile filter; the consumer injects
*what* is forbidden (e.g. Hamilton injects the song's lyric lines).

Not legal advice.
