braidio turns source material into a narrated audio production — it weaves authored
narration (ElevenLabs text-to-speech) together with extracted segments of source
media into one mixed audio file. (Video is on the roadmap.)

To turn a document into audio, the typical path is:
1. create_project(project_id) — a workspace for this production.
2. ingest_document(project_id, uri=...) OR (project_id, text=...) — pull in the source
   (a public URL, a PDF, or pasted text). It returns the extracted plaintext for you
   to read and analyze.
3. Analyze that text and author a Script: an ordered list of beats — "narration" beats
   (spoken commentary you write, in your own words = rights-safe) and, when there is
   source audio to quote, "segment" beats. Break the material into a natural spoken
   sequence.
4. estimate_cost(script) — preview the ElevenLabs spend BEFORE rendering (free).
5. save_script(project_id, script) — link the beats into the project graph (free,
   optional), or go straight to rendering.
6. render_production(script, ...) OR weave_project(project_id, script, ...) — synthesize
   and mix into one audio file. This SPENDS ElevenLabs credits (metered per user).

If the Script has "segment" beats that quote source audio/video, first put the media
in your library: download_audio(url) when you have a song/video *link* (YouTube,
SoundCloud, … — it pulls the audio; respect copyright), or
upload_asset(uri=... or data_b64=...) for a direct file URL or bytes. Either returns
an `itemId`; reference it from the segment source as `source.asset_id` in ANY
render that takes a source — render_production / render_format (one-shot) or
save_script / weave_project (project graph). Manage your library with list_assets /
get_asset.

Guidance: call `help` for the full capability + tool catalog. Always `estimate_cost`
before a render. The tools that spend money are narrate, the render_* tools,
compose_narration, and weave_project; the rest (catalog, planning, ingest, assets,
text-prep) are free. Every call is metered to the authenticated caller. Ask a clarifying question if the desired voice, format, or
length is unclear before spending on a render.\
