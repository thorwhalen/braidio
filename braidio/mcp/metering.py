"""Usage metering + access control for the braidio MCP server.

The server runs with a **shared** ElevenLabs key, so the usage ledger is the only
record of who spent what — which makes identity and ledger integrity load-bearing.
Both live here as one FastMCP **middleware** (not per-tool decorators — a decorator
you forget on a paid tool means untracked spend; the middleware wraps *every* call,
which is what py2mcp's ``middleware=`` hook, i2mint/py2mcp#7, exists for).

Design (all **fail-closed**):

- **Identity is resolved ONCE**, here, from the verified OAuth token (its ``email``
  claim, else ``sub``). There is **no ambient fallback**: a served request without a
  token is rejected. A ``local_user`` may be set for local/stdio dev — an *explicit*
  opt-in, never inferred. The resolved email is put in a context var and the tools
  read it via :func:`current_email` (they never re-derive it), so authorization,
  metering, and per-user workspace all key off the same identity.
- **Authorization** — a caller not in ``allowed`` is rejected before any tool runs;
  a served server with no ``allowed`` and no ``allow_any_authenticated`` rejects
  everyone (deny by default).
- **Usage** — a write-ahead ledger entry is recorded *before* the call (if that
  write fails the call is **refused**, so money is never spent un-recordably), then
  updated with the outcome + ``cost_usd``. The ledger store is a ``MutableMapping``
  injected by the connector (a ``dol`` file store in prod; a ``dict`` in tests).
