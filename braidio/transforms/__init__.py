"""braidio's concrete ``nw.Transform`` pipeline — registered on import.

The ``Transform`` *abstraction* lives in ``nw`` (per the federation prime
directive); this package holds braidio's concrete audio-render instances and
registers them with ``nw.transforms`` as a side effect of import. It turns the
authoring graph (narrative beats, dialogue beats, audio clips, a weave-config)
into render-provenance nodes, all written **through** ``project.graph`` so
``nw.stale_after`` drives partial re-render — one freshness engine, not
braidio's parallel standalone ``record_render`` store.

The chain (``sources → segments → weave``):

- ``beat_to_voice_assignment.default`` — narrative beat (+ weave-config) →
  ``voice-assignment/v1`` (deterministic; no synthesis).
- ``narration_render.tts`` — narrative beat (+ voice-assignment + config) →
  ``narration-render/v1`` (ElevenLabs TTS; cached by an explicit ``cache_key``).
- ``dialogue_render.tts`` — dialogue beat (+ the singleton dialogue-cast) →
  ``dialogue-render/v1`` (ElevenLabs Text-to-Dialogue, one pass per exchange;
  cached by an explicit ``cache_key``; thorwhalen/braidio#46).
- ``segment_extraction.ffmpeg`` — audio clip (+ source-media + config) →
  ``segment-extraction/v1`` (ffmpeg cut+pad; cached).
- ``weave_to_episode.default`` — all member renders, plus any scene-break
  nodes (+ config, + the production-structure and render-profile nodes when
  there are any) → one ``episode-render/v1`` (the ``projection_entrypoint`` —
  the delivered mix).

The rights :class:`~braidio.rights.Profile` is applied once, at ingest, by the
same :func:`braidio.rights.plan_production` the no-graph path runs — so a beat
the profile refuses never becomes a node, and no Transform re-decides rights.

:func:`weave_project` is the synchronous convenience driver; the Transforms
are independently registered so nw / reelee can drive them via the
``commentary_weave`` genre (see :mod:`braidio.genre`).

    """Ingest ``script`` and run the whole commentary-weave chain, in order.

    Returns the completed ``episode-render/v1`` annotation (its body carries
    the assembled audio's ``url`` + ``artifact_id``). A thin synchronous
    projection over the registered Transforms' ``plan``/``execute`` contract —
    each ``plan`` resolves its own context (config / voice-assignment /
    source-media / production-structure / dialogue-cast) from the graph, so
    the driver only supplies the primary input. A cost-gated / async runner
    (``nw.jobs``, reelee's planner) can drive the same Transforms via the
    genre.

    ``fmt`` (a :class:`~braidio.formats.Format`) supplies the format's declared
    defaults — its ``weave`` config, its ``structure`` and its dialogue
    ``cast`` — for whichever of ``config`` / ``structure`` / ``cast`` the
    caller left out; an explicit argument always wins. ``bed`` is the
    app-supplied music bed (:class:`~braidio.music.MusicBed`). With no format,
    no structure and no bed, this is the plain weave it always was
    (thorwhalen/braidio#39).

    ``cast`` (a :class:`~braidio.conversation.ConversationCast`) is what the
    script's :class:`~braidio.script.Dialogue` beats are voiced with, resolved
    exactly as :func:`braidio.render.render_production` / ``render_format``
    resolve it: explicit, else the format's, else
    :data:`~braidio.conversation.DEFAULT_CAST`. It is recorded as the singleton
    ``dialogue-cast/v1`` node only when the script has a dialogue beat, and
    each ``dialogue-render/v1`` derives from it (thorwhalen/braidio#46).

    ``profile`` (a :class:`~braidio.rights.Profile`) and ``rights`` (a
    :class:`~braidio.rights.RightsPolicy`) are the rights seam, and they mean
    exactly what they mean on :func:`braidio.render.render_production`: the
    script is filtered through :func:`~braidio.rights.plan_production` at
    ingest, so a segment the profile refuses is never extracted and never
    reaches the mix. ``None`` leaves the profile undeclared, which resolves to
    :data:`~braidio.rights.DEFAULT_PROFILE` — the fast path's default, and the
    behaviour every project had before (thorwhalen/braidio#47).

    **Re-running on the same project is the way to change any of this.**
    :func:`ingest_script` reconciles the graph by identity (the singleton
    tiers by tier, beats by script position): an unchanged beat keeps its node
    and its render is a cache hit, a changed config / profile / structure is
    rewritten under its existing id so every render that derived from it reads
    stale through provenance, and a beat the new profile refuses is removed.
    The weave is idempotent too: a render whose inputs are unchanged and still
    fresh is reused rather than duplicated, and a re-run with nothing changed
    returns the episode already there and writes nothing. After a real change
    the previous episode stays in the graph as history, stale; the returned
    one is current (thorwhalen/braidio#51).

    ``api_key`` is the caller's ElevenLabs key, and means exactly what it
    means on :func:`braidio.render.render_production`: ``None`` (default)
    resolves from the process environment. It reaches the two synthesis
    Transforms through nw's ``execute(secrets=)`` seam — as
    ``{"elevenlabs": api_key}``, to those two and no other — and nothing in
    the graph: not a node, not provenance, not a ``cache_key``
    (thorwhalen/braidio#58).
