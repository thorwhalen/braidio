"""Shared helpers for braidio's ``nw.Transform`` pipeline.

The transforms in this package turn braidio's authoring graph (narrative
beats, dialogue beats, audio clips, scene breaks, a weave-config +
production-structure + dialogue-cast snapshot) into render-provenance nodes
(voice-assignment, narration-render, dialogue-render, segment-extraction,
episode-render),
writing each **through** ``project.graph`` so ``nw.stale_after`` traverses
them. This is the whole point of riding nw: one freshness engine over the
project graph — *not* braidio's parallel standalone ``record_render`` store
(which stays as the no-nw fast path in :mod:`braidio.provenance`).

Tier-name constants mirror :mod:`braidio.bodies._tiers`; body schemas live in
:mod:`braidio.bodies`.

#: added beside the first would leave the old renders looking fresh (the
