"""``weave_to_episode.default`` — weave member renders into one episode.

A **batch** local-render Transform (N inputs → 1 output): it consumes all the
narration-render + dialogue-render + segment-extraction nodes (in order) —
the two spoken kinds weave alike — and mixes them with
``braidio.weave_timeline`` (duck/crossfade/loudness from the weave-config),
and emits one ``episode-render/v1`` referencing the assembled audio. It
derives from ``[*members, weave-config]``, so any member re-render (or a
config change) re-stales the episode — the top of the partial-re-render DAG.

**Structural music** (thorwhalen/braidio#39) rides the same list: a
``scene-break/v1`` node is a member with no render node of its own, and the
weave turns it into a sting or a pause via ``braidio.structure`` — the same
primitives the no-graph path uses, never a forked DSP. When the project carries
a ``production-structure/v1`` node the episode also derives from it, so
swapping the sting asset or flipping fade-to-spotlight re-stales exactly the
episode; when it does not, nothing about the plan or the render changes.

The **rights profile** rides the same seam (thorwhalen/braidio#47), with one
difference that matters. The episode's ``profile`` used to be the literal
``"personal"``, so a graph render claimed a personal cut whatever was actually
asked for. It is now read from the ``render-profile/v1`` node the ingest wrote,
a declared input of this Transform.

But the filtering happens **once, at ingest**, so — unlike the sting asset — a
changed profile cannot be repaired by re-running this Transform. Re-staling
only the episode is therefore a *hazard*, not the feature it is for the other
inputs: it invites exactly the wrong repair, re-weaving the members the old
profile chose under the new profile's name. So this Transform does not trust
the label. It re-asks :func:`braidio.rights.clip_plays_under` — the same rule
:func:`~braidio.rights.plan_production` applied at ingest, asked again, never
reimplemented — over its clip members, and raises
:class:`~braidio.rights.RightsViolation` when they disagree with the profile it
is about to stamp on them. A profile change is only correctly applied by
re-ingesting the script.

**The timeline is persisted** (commentary-studio plan §3). The graph path used
to produce none — ``weave_timeline`` returns only a ``Path`` — so the cut
points a picture track needs died with the process. ``execute`` now builds a
:class:`~braidio.timeline.TimelineBreakdown` from the *same* members,
durations and layout knobs it hands the mixer, and writes it into
``EpisodeRenderBodyV1.timeline``. For a row written before that field existed,
:func:`episode_timeline` reconstructs it through the same function from
``ordered_member_ids`` + each member's duration — the two traps being that a
``segment-extraction`` stores ``start_s``/``end_s`` of the *unpadded* window
(the rendered clip is longer, by the weave-config's pads and its minimum
length) and a ``scene-break`` carries no duration at all (its pause comes from
``production-structure.structure["pause_s"]``, or its sting from the sting
knobs). Both are answered by probing the member's rendered file where it
still exists — the probe the renderer itself used — and by reproducing the
renderer's arithmetic where it does not.

This is the genre's ``projection_entrypoint``: the step that turns the graph
into the delivered artifact.
