"""Ingest a braidio :class:`~braidio.script.Script` into an nw project graph.

The script is first filtered through :func:`braidio.rights.plan_production` —
the *same* rights filter the no-graph fast path
(:func:`braidio.render.render_production`) runs, not a second copy of it — so a
beat the profile refuses is never ingested, never extracted, and never paid
for, and a beat it substitutes is ingested as the substitute
(thorwhalen/braidio#47).

This writes the **authoring** layer the render Transforms consume:

- one ``render-profile/v1`` snapshot when the production declares a profile —
  the rights decision plus what it dropped/substituted;
- one ``weave-config/v1`` snapshot (the singleton render-choices node);
- one ``production-structure/v1`` snapshot when the production declares
  structural music (stings / fade-to-spotlight / a music bed) — written only
  then, so a format that declares none leaves the graph untouched;
- one ``narrative-beat/v1`` per :class:`~braidio.script.Narration`;
- one ``scene-break/v1`` per :class:`~braidio.script.SceneBreak` — the
  structural boundary, ordered with the rest of the spine (thorwhalen/braidio#39);
- a ``source-media/v1`` + ``audio-clip/v1`` pair per
  :class:`~braidio.script.SegmentBeat` (its playable window resolved via a
  :class:`~braidio.sources.SegmentSource`).

Everything is written **through** ``project.graph.add_annotation`` so the
whole pipeline (authoring → render) lives in one graph that
``nw.stale_after`` can traverse. :class:`~braidio.script.Dialogue` beats are
not yet ingested (a documented follow-up — they need ``render_dialogue``
wiring and a turns-carrying beat body).

Two phases, and the order is the point (thorwhalen/braidio#49, #51)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Plan** is pure: the rights plan, every ``SegmentSource.resolve``, every
asset content-hash and the Dialogue refusal all happen before anything is
written, so a failure leaves the graph exactly as it was. **Commit** writes
*by identity* under the rule stated once in
:data:`braidio.transforms._common.SINGLETON_TIERS`: a node whose identity
already exists is replaced under its **existing annotation id** (and not
written at all when its value is unchanged), a node whose identity the new
plan no longer names is removed, and a tier that was doubled by an earlier
half-written ingest is reconciled back to one. Same-id replacement is what
carries the change to the render nodes — their verifying traces record each
parent's value digest, so a rewritten config or profile reads
``upstream-changed`` and a removed beat ``upstream-missing`` — and it is what
makes the whole write idempotent: a retry after a failure converges instead
of doubling, and re-ingesting the same script twice writes nothing.

    :class:`SegmentBeat`\\ s — it resolves each reference to a playable window.

    ``structure`` (a :class:`~braidio.structure.MusicStructure`, typically a
    format's declared one) and ``bed`` (a :class:`~braidio.music.MusicBed`) are
    the production's structural music. Given either, one

    byte-for-byte what it was before this layer existed.

    projection and ``rights`` (a :class:`~braidio.rights.RightsPolicy`) the

    default the fast path uses), which passes every beat through unchanged, and
    no ``render-profile/v1`` node is written.

    **Re-ingest.** Calling this again on the same project is how a script,
    format or profile change reaches the graph. Nodes are matched by identity
    (the singleton tiers by tier, beats by their zero-padded script index):
    an unchanged node is left alone, a changed one is rewritten under its
    existing id so its renders read stale through provenance, and one the new
    plan no longer names is removed. Nothing is written until the whole plan
    has validated, so a failing source or asset leaves the graph untouched
