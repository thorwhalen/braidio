"""``video_panels.plan`` — an episode + its stills → the panel track.

A **free, batch** Transform (commentary-studio plan §5): one ``episode-render``
plus the project's ``still`` nodes in, one ``video-panel/v1`` annotation per
span out. Spans come from :func:`braidio.video.plan_spans` over the episode's
**persisted** timeline (reconstructed for rows that predate it, see
:func:`braidio.transforms.episode_timeline`), so the cuts land where the
narration changes subject and survive a reopen. Each panel is pinned to its
span through a :class:`lacing.MediaRef` on the episode's audio, which is what
makes "which panel covers *t*?" an interval query rather than a scan.

Assignment takes an explicit **pick map** — ``params["picks"]``, ``{beat_id:
[still_key, ...]}``, the shape the finished productions already used — and
falls back to cycling the pool without a back-to-back repeat (the
:func:`braidio.video.assign_stills` rule) for any beat it does not name. A key
the pool does not hold raises at plan time: a silent fallback would ship a
picture nobody chose.

**The seed is minted from the beat, not the ordinal.** ``mint_seed(beat_id,
k)`` hashes the beat's id and the panel's index *within that beat*, so a
panel's camera move survives a reorder, a re-weave and a still swap — "keep
this move, change this picture" is the first thing the owner asked for, and
``i % 4`` could not express it.

**A panel derives from the episode, not from its still.** ``still_id`` is an
authored pointer — the same shape as ``audio-clip.source_node_id`` — and the
panel's *value* never reads the still, so a provenance edge to it would make
every label edit on a still stale the panel (and, through it, every cut)
with nothing to re-derive. The **cuts** derive from the stills: a still's
label edit stales the cuts, and the motion pass answers from its cache while
the text pass re-runs — which is the split earning itself. Swapping the
picture is a patch to ``still_id`` (the panel's own digest moves); replacing
the bytes is a new still with a new artifact id, then that patch.

**A track is an identity.** Every panel a plan writes carries the same
``track_id``, minted once per plan run, so two plans over one episode stay
apart: :func:`tracks_for_episode` groups them and :func:`panels_for_episode`
returns the latest. ``execute`` is idempotent by *authored value* — when the
latest track already places the same stills over the same spans, it is
returned and nothing is written, **even if its moves have since been
edited** (the edit is the point of the track); a plan that says something
else (different picks, different bounds) writes a new track beside it,
never over it. ``force=True``
writes a new track even when the value is the same. After a re-weave the new
episode has no track yet, so the planner plans anew; carry choices forward
with :func:`picks_from_panels` over the old track.

**Every placement says why, and how well it fits** (thorwhalen/braidio#85).
Each panel records the words spoken under it (``anchor_text``), the author's
reason (``rationale``, from a ``{still_key, reason}`` pick), a ``relevance``
score from a pluggable scorer (``params["relevance"]``, see
:mod:`braidio.relevance`) and a ``role`` — ``literal`` / ``contextual`` /
``decorative``, or ``None`` when nobody said. The knobs:

- ``min_relevance`` (default :data:`DEFAULT_MIN_RELEVANCE`): a placement
  scoring below it is *decorative*, whatever it claimed;
- ``allow_decorative`` (default ``True``): ``False`` refuses any decorative
  placement, a float caps decorative screen time at that share;
- ``allow_disclaimed`` (default ``False``): whether a pick may be marked
  ``disclaimed`` — the "right-shaped, wrong-specific, rescued by its label"
  placement. Off, such a pick refuses; on, the cut shows its label for the
  whole panel and no card in the label's slot may hide it;
- ``pick_scope`` (default ``"beat"``): ``"span"`` chooses, for each span,
  the most relevant still among the beat's picks (or the pool) for the words
  under *that span*, instead of taking the beat's list positionally.

The defaults keep a re-plan of an existing track placing the same stills
over the same spans: nothing is refused unless a caller asks for it, and the
new fields only describe the placement. The flip side: because the
assessment fields (``anchor_text``, ``relevance``, ``scorer``, ``role``) are
not part of a track's identity, a re-plan whose only change is a pick's
``role`` — or a first scoring of a track planned before these fields
existed — returns the existing track; pass ``force=True`` to write the
assessed track. :func:`placement_report` lists what
a reviewer should look at.
